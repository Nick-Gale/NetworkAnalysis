# Module containing functions related to plotting.


# NOTE: Plotting is difficult. Do we implement a custom solution or rely on libraries. The custom solution gels well with recipe cards. The libraries, however, are comprehensive and well developed. Ideally, we integrate the two.
# NOTE: Integrating with libraries necessitates bundling dependencies. Do we stick to Python only programs? MRtrix is a good counter exmaple
